## System Overview

### Purpose
This document provides comprehensive implementation guidelines for a distributed multi-branch banking system built on ERPNext. The system is designed to allow 89 branches and headquarters to operate independently while maintaining data consistency through periodic synchronization.

### Key Design Principles
- **Branch Autonomy**: Each branch operates independently with its local ERPNext instance
- **Resilient Operations**: Core banking functions continue during network outages
- **Selective Synchronization**: Only necessary data is synchronized between branches and HQ
- **Secure Communication**: All data transfers are encrypted and authenticated
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Centralized visibility into all system components

### System Components
1. **Branch Systems**: 89 independent ERPNext instances with local databases
2. **Headquarters System**: Central ERPNext instance with consolidated database
3. **Synchronization Infrastructure**: Message queues, CDC services, and replication tools
4. **Monitoring Platform**: Centralized monitoring and alerting system
5. **Deployment Infrastructure**: Tools for consistent deployment and updates

## Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture
The system follows a distributed architecture with a central hub (HQ) and independent nodes (branches). Each branch maintains its own database and application stack while synchronizing with HQ on a scheduled basis.

## Network Infrastructure

### Network Topology
The system uses a hub-and-spoke network topology with HQ as the central hub and branches as spokes. Each branch connects to HQ via a secure WireGuard VPN tunnel.

### Branch Connectivity Requirements
- **Static IP**: Each branch should have a static IP address
- **Bandwidth**: Minimum 10 Mbps dedicated bandwidth
- **Firewall**: Configured to allow only necessary traffic
- **Redundancy**: Secondary internet connection where possible

### Alternative Connectivity Options

#### Branches Without Leased Lines
For branches without dedicated leased lines but with static IP addresses and server firewalls:

1. **Connection Method**: 
   - Use secure site-to-site VPN over public internet
   - Implement aggressive reconnection policies
   - Configure automatic failover to cellular backup where available

2. **Security Requirements**:
   - Dedicated hardware firewall with IPS/IDS capabilities
   - Strict outbound connection rules (whitelist approach)
   - Regular security audits and penetration testing
   - VPN traffic inspection and anomaly detection

3. **Configuration Example**:
```bash
# Branch Firewall Configuration (Example for pfSense/OPNsense)
# Allow only specific outbound connections
pass out quick from $BRANCH_LAN to $HQ_VPN_ENDPOINT port 51820 keep state
pass out quick from $BRANCH_LAN to $HQ_BACKUP_ENDPOINT port 51820 keep state
block out all

# Rate limiting for VPN connections
table <vpn_abusers> persist
block quick from <vpn_abusers>
pass in on $WAN_INTERFACE proto udp from any to ($WAN_INTERFACE) port 51820 flags S/SA keep state \
    (max-src-conn 10, max-src-conn-rate 3/5, overload <vpn_abusers> flush global)
```

4. **Synchronization Adjustments**:
   - Implement store-and-forward mechanism for transactions
   - Schedule synchronization during off-peak hours
   - Compress data before transmission
   - Implement bandwidth throttling during business hours

5. **Monitoring Requirements**:
   - Real-time connection status monitoring
   - Bandwidth utilization tracking
   - Latency and packet loss measurements
   - Automated alerts for connection issues

### VPN Configuration
WireGuard VPN will be configured with the following parameters:

```
# HQ WireGuard Configuration
[Interface]
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820
PrivateKey = <HQ_PRIVATE_KEY>

# Branch 001 Peer Configuration
[Peer]
PublicKey = <BRANCH001_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25

# Branch 002 Peer Configuration
[Peer]
PublicKey = <BRANCH002_PUBLIC_KEY>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.3/32
PersistentKeepalive = 25

# Additional branch configurations follow the same pattern
```

### Network Security Measures
1. **Firewall Rules**: Restrict traffic to necessary ports and protocols
2. **Intrusion Detection**: Deploy IDS/IPS at network boundaries
3. **Traffic Encryption**: All traffic encrypted via VPN
4. **Network Segmentation**: Separate networks for different functions

## Database Architecture

### Database Structure
Each branch and HQ will have a PostgreSQL database with the following characteristics:

#### Branch Database
- Contains all ERPNext doctypes
- Stores local transactions and customer data
- Includes branch-specific configurations
- Uses logical replication for synchronization

#### HQ Database
- Contains all ERPNext doctypes
- Stores consolidated data from all branches
- Maintains master records and configurations
- Uses multiple schemas for branch data separation

### Data Classification
Data is classified into different categories that determine synchronization behavior:

1. **Local-Only Data**: Never leaves the branch
   - Temporary records
   - Session data
   - Detailed audit logs
   - Branch-specific settings

2. **Branch-to-HQ Data**: Synchronized from branch to HQ
   - Completed financial transactions
   - Customer information updates
   - Regulatory reporting data
   - Aggregate statistics

3. **HQ-to-Branch Data**: Synchronized from HQ to branches
   - Master records (currencies, products)
   - Policy updates
   - Exchange rates
   - User permissions

4. **Global Data**: Synchronized bidirectionally
   - Critical configuration
   - System-wide settings
   - Global customer information

### Replication Configuration
PostgreSQL logical replication will be configured as follows:

```sql
-- At Branch
-- Create publication for outgoing data
CREATE PUBLICATION branch_outgoing FOR TABLE 
  teller_invoice, currency_exchange, customer, teller_treasury
  WHERE (status = 'Completed' OR sync_required = TRUE);

-- At HQ
-- Create subscription for each branch
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION branch_001_incoming 
  CONNECTION 'host=branch001.bank.com port=5432 dbname=erpnext user=repl_user password=xxx' 
  PUBLICATION branch_outgoing;

-- Create publication for outgoing data to branches
CREATE PUBLICATION hq_outgoing FOR TABLE 
  currency_exchange, teller_setting, user, permission;

-- At Branch
-- Create subscription for HQ data
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION hq_incoming
  CONNECTION 'host=hq.bank.com port=5432 dbname=erpnext user=repl_user password=xxx'
  PUBLICATION hq_outgoing;
```

### Conflict Resolution Strategy
The system implements the following conflict resolution strategies:

1. **Timestamp-Based Resolution**: Latest change wins
2. **Authority-Based Resolution**: HQ changes override branch changes for master data
3. **Merge Resolution**: Combine non-conflicting changes
4. **Manual Resolution**: Flag irreconcilable conflicts for manual review

## Synchronization Mechanisms

### Synchronization Components
The synchronization system consists of the following components:

1. **Change Data Capture (CDC) Service**: Monitors database changes
2. **Message Broker**: Reliably delivers change events
3. **Synchronization Manager**: Processes and applies changes
4. **Conflict Resolution Service**: Resolves data conflicts
5. **Synchronization Dashboard**: Monitors synchronization status

### Synchronization Flows

#### Branch to HQ Synchronization
```
Branch DB → Debezium Connector → Kafka Topic → 
HQ Sync Consumer → Conflict Resolution → HQ DB
```

#### HQ to Branch Synchronization
```
HQ DB → Debezium Connector → Kafka Topic → 
Branch Sync Consumer → Conflict Resolution → Branch DB
```

#### Branch to Branch Communication
```
Branch A → API Gateway → HQ Message Queue → 
Branch B Service → Branch B
```

### Synchronization Schedule
- **Transaction Data**: Near real-time (batched every 5 minutes)
- **Master Data**: Hourly synchronization
- **Configuration Changes**: Immediate push notification
- **Full Reconciliation**: Daily during off-hours

### Outbox Pattern Implementation
To ensure reliable delivery of changes, the system implements the outbox pattern:

1. Database changes are captured in an outbox table
2. A service processes the outbox and publishes to Kafka
3. Once successfully published, entries are marked as processed
4. A cleanup job removes processed entries after retention period

```sql
CREATE TABLE sync_outbox (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  table_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  operation TEXT NOT NULL,
  record_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  processed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  processed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_sync_outbox_processed ON sync_outbox(processed);
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Branch Deployment Architecture
Each branch will have the following server architecture:

1. **Application Server**: Runs ERPNext application
2. **Database Server**: Runs PostgreSQL database
3. **Synchronization Server**: Runs synchronization services
4. **Monitoring Agent**: Collects and forwards metrics

For smaller branches, these components may be consolidated on fewer physical servers.

### Standardized Installation Process
